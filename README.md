### Space Game

8/22/2025

This project is a single player game that relies on a user controlled object and collision detection between different objects.  The project includes Array Lists and Boolean Variables to render multiple instances of the same object, while keeping the properties of objects like lasers and obstacles the same within their class.  The project also utilizes nested for-loops to aid with the functionality of Array Lists and object collision.  The game also has many hidden variables to determine size, position, and speed for objects, as well as variables to keep track of important information like player score, health, ammunition.

## Projects for Term 2

### Anyone Can Cook

12/15/2025

This project is a metroidvania platformer that relies on realistic gravity functions and collision with the map.  This project uses CSV files in order to quickly create new and unique maps, and defining the cell type in our code lets each cell have unique physical characteristics.  This code also utilizes switch statements to change screens smoothly during gameplay and make the code more efficient.  The project also uses PVectors and Array Lists to have individual enemies appear on the screen at a reasonable rate to avoid crashing the game.  This project is not complete, and there are still more tasks to be completed in the code and visuals of the game.
