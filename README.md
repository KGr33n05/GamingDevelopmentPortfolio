### Space Game

8/22/2025

This project is a single player game that relies on a user controlled object and collision detection between different objects.  The project includes Array Lists and Boolean Variables to render multiple instances of the same object, while keeping the properties of objects like lasers and obstacles the same within their class.  The project also utilizes nested for-loops to aid with the functionality of Array Lists and object collision.  The game also has many variables to determine size, position, and speed for objects, as well as variables to keep track of important information like player score, health, and ammunition.
